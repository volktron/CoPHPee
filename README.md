# CoPHPee

CoPHPee, pronounced "Coffee" is a lightweight PHP framework for setting up backend APIs.

## Why?

```
Sure, I could just use laravel - in fact this framework is heavily inspired by it.
I just want to implement my own thing as a portfolio piece as well as have 
something to build personal projects on.

If people like it and use it I will be happy to keep maintaining it.
